Live Instance: Connected to the small running vSphere environment in the lab.
There isn't a large inventory of objects in this instance but it allows us to interact with vCenter.
• Historical Instance: Running a 30-minute time loop of data that was captured in the past. This instance has a much larger inventory of objects but since it is not currently connected to a vCenter, we can't perform any actions here.
• Blue Medora Management Packs: Also running in historical mode, this instance has a large number of management packs from Blue Medora that allow us to see information from adjacent infrastructure (storage and physical servers) as well as operating system and application information.
